:::note
The app takes \~500MB of disk space in a typical scenario. It is recommended to ensure \~750MB of available space if you wish to import a lot of [projects](/usage/projects), or have large files per project.
:::

Installing the app on your Android device is pretty straightforward. You can get the app from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/xyz.jekyllex/).

Or, download the `.apk` file from the assets section at the bottom of the [latest GitHub release](https://github.com/jekyllex/jekyllex-android/releases/latest) page on the app's GitHub repository.

:::note
Please use the app from downloaded from an official release source only. I do not publish the app anywhere other than GtiHub or F-Droid.
:::

If downloading from GitHub, click on the file from your browser's download section or your file manager, once the download finishes.

You will be prompted with a dialog to install the app. Click on the Install button and the app will be installed on your device.

If it is your first time installing an app from a source other than the Google Play store, you will be prompted to enable installing apps from external sources in the device settings. You have to enable that setting before proceeding to install the app with the steps mentioned above.

You may also be warned with the file being *potentially* harmful (a standard notice) which does not mean it actually is.

If you are concerned about the app's trustability, please feel free to upload the file to tools like [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com) (by Google) to run it through multiple anti-virus checks before installing.

## Why is the app not on Google Play?

I am a young old software developer from India. I began with Android when I was 13 and had purchased a play store developer account back then. But I had no one to guide me around the legal aspects.

I had published some apps for Google services like Firebase and Admob because they did not exist. Within around a week they had reached 500+ installs in total. Google noticed and since I had used their logo, the apps were flagged for copyright infringement, and without notice to remove them I was banned from the play store.

That ban is permanent and google never listened to my appeal requests because I was underage. And still their bot emails never let me get in touch with a real human to resolve the case. I can't even get another developer account because I have done it once and that too got terminated. They can easily make out that it is me trying.

So all I can do for now is publish on GitHub. All the components of the app are open source, so one can take a look around all the software components to verify legitimacy. The [builds are automated](https://github.com/jekyllex/jekyllex-android/blob/main/.github/workflows/build-apk.yml) so you get an APK that isn't tempered with at all, if you install it from the official repository.

For now play store seems a long shot unless someone takes the responsibility for hosting the app on their account â€” which is still risky because the APK signatures are on my name. Only if someone from Google helps out...
