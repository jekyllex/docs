## Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation of the [JekyllEx](https://jekyllex.xyz) app. In this article you will understand what JekyllEx is.

import jekyllex from '@/assets/jekyllex.png';
import CenterWrapper from '@/components/CenterWrapper.astro';

<CenterWrapper>
  <img width="200px" alt="JekyllEx app logo" src={jekyllex.src} />
</CenterWrapper>

In simple terms: **JekyllEx is the mobile IDE for Jekyll**.

For understanding what JekyllEx does, one needs to know what Jekyll is.

## What is Jekyll?

Here's what the [Jekyll's official repository's](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) describes:

> &#x20;Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator perfect for personal, project, or organization sites. Think of it like a file-based CMS, without all the complexity. Jekyll takes your content, renders Markdown and Liquid templates, and spits out a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache, Nginx or another web server.

In simple terms, Jekyll removes all the hassle of a server-based CMS (like WordPress, Ghost, etc.) and gives you the freedom to write simple markdown text, and converts that into a website!

The best part is, since Jekyll is the engine behind [GiHub Pages](https://pages.github.com), you can host the static sites built by Jekyll on GitHub Pages for free. It is as simple as putting the Jekyll project on GitHub and configuring gh-pages, which is really simple!

## How does JekyllEx help?

JekyllEx provides an intuitive UI in an Android app to create/edit and manage your Jekyll blog posts directly from your mobile device!
