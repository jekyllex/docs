import { Aside } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The home page of the app is like the desktop folder on your computer. This place is meant to view / create / import your Jekyll projects.

:::note
A Jekyll projects is just a folder that contains content that adheres to Jekyll's [directory structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/).
:::

As soon as the app loads, it will show the projects that are loaded.

If you've just begun using the app, you will see a "**Create**" button to generate a "**test**" project with the jekyll starter template.

For existing projects, JekyllEx will render additional details regarding your project like the site title, description, size on disk, etc., if possible. It does so by reading the `_config.yml` file inside the project.

## Create / import projects

Press the "**+**" icon on the top right of the app bar. This will open a dialog where you can both create and import jekyll projects.

* Typing a **Name** will create a new jekyll blog with the default starter template in the folder with the the same same.
* Typing a valid **URL** will try to clone the repository at the URL using `git`.
* Typing a `git` **command** will execute it as it is.

:::note
If you are trying to import a private GitHub repository, you will first need to set up [authentication with GitHub](https://docs.jekyllex.xyz/settings#authentication).
:::

As soon as the action is complete, the dialog closes and the list refereshes to show the latest projects and info possible.

You may create empty folders in the home directory using commands like `mkdir` from the [terminal](https://docs.jekyllex.xyz/usage/terminal "mention"). In such a case, you will need to refresh the list manually from the "**⋮**" dropdown menu.

Even though you can use `touch` or `curl` to create files, the home page will only list the folders present there.

:::note
**Note:** If you want to be able to [preview](https://docs.jekyllex.xyz/usage/previewing) your jekyll site, it must be at the home directory. Please use `mv` in the terminal to move at the top level if it is in a sub-directory.

## Install dependencies

This step is required to prepare your new project for [previewing](https://docs.jekyllex.xyz/usage/previewing "mention") locally.

If you created a new project from within the app, unless the [#skip-bundle-install](https://docs.jekyllex.xyz/settings#skip-bundle-install "mention") setting is enabled, jekyll will automatically do this for you. If not, please continue reading.

After importing a project, all you need to do is navigate inside it and press the "**bundle install**" option from the "**⋮**" menu on the top right and bundler will try to resolve and set up the required dependencies. You can view it's progress live from the terminal.

Dependency installation can be prone to errors, but most can be overcome. Please see the [troubleshooting](https://docs.jekyllex.xyz/other/troubleshooting "mention") guide for help with common issues.
