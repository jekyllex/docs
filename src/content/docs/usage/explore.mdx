The home page of the app lists files and folders in the app's home directory. If a folder is a jekyll [project](https://docs.jekyllex.xyz/usage/projects), it lists additional info if [enabled](https://docs.jekyllex.xyz/settings#reduce-animations) and retrievable via `_config.yml` inside the folder.

If there are more than one item listed, you can search through the available items using the search bar.

Clicking on a folder will take you inside and list the files and folders under it.

Clicking on a file can perform two actions:

* If it is an editable text/code file that the app's inbuilt [Editor](https://docs.jekyllex.xyz/manage#editing-content) can handle, it will be opened there.
* Else you will get a list of apps that can open the given file type (for example Images, PDFs, etc.)

:::note
**Tip**: If you have a preferred editor of choice, you can long press on a file to open it in an external app to be able to edit it from there!
:::

When the folders are navigated, the terminal also changes its directory correspondingly. Commands that are run in the terminal will be executed from the context of the currently opened folder.
